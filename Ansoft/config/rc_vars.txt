    stores user preferences and data set by the software.  Changing the
    location of this directory will also affect the location of the
    sub-directories: 'macros', 'colors', 'maxwelldb', 'parts', and 'symbols'.
    This variable will not appear in the resource file if its
    default value is used.
END

B_DIR SUGGEST_DEFAULT

    is automatically searched when the software is looking for a macro.
    This variable will not appear in the resource file if its
    default value is used.
END

B_DIR
    SharedMacros
    Sets the location of an optional macro repository shared by 
    multiple users.  This directory is automatically searched 
    when the software is looking for a macro.
END

    ColorDir
    Sets the location of the 'colors' directory.  This is
    the directory where the .rgb color files are stored.
    This variable will not appear in the resource file if its

    default value is used.
END


B_DIR SUGGEST_DEFAULT
    PartsDir
    Sets the location of the 'partsdb' directory.  This directory 
    stores Spice models exported from Maxwell Spicelink or Ansoft High
    Frequency Structure Simulator.
    This variable will not appear in the resource file if its
    default value is used.
END

B_DIR SUGGEST_DEFAULT
    SymbolDir
    Sets the location of the 'symboldb' directory.  This directory
    holds the screen shots corresponding to the models in the 'partsdb'
    directory. 
    This variable will not appear in the resource file if its
    default value is used.
END

B_DIR SUGGEST_DEFAULT
    ScriptDir

    Used by the ParICs product.
    This variable tells ParICs where to find the various package 
    master descriptions.  This is ordinarily a directory where
    the user has read and write permissions, such as 
    ~/Maxwell/pardata.
END

B_DIR
    PicPath
    Used by the ParICs product.
    This is the location of the various ParICs executables.  
    Typically this is a subdirectory of your Ansoft software 
    installation directory, such as /usr/ansoft/parc3.
