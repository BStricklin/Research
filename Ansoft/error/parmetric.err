1324 user
1324 Optimizer needs valid starting values for the input variables.
1324 The nominal values of these variables and the values (if any)
1324 set in the parametric table rows are invalid - they are
1324 either out of bounds or don't satisfy the constraints specified
1324 in the optimization setup.
1324 Either change the bounds or constraints on these variables or
1324 add a row to the table which has valid values. Note that the
1324 specified values cannot be equal to the minimum or maximum
1324 but should lie in between.
