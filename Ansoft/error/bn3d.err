1026    fatal
1026    Error in writing the $$1 file.
1026    Possible causes are:
1026       - Out of disk space.
1026       - No file access privileges.
1026       - Network or hardware problems.

1027    user
1027    You are trying to set current source on an invalid entity.
1027    Current source can only be set on faces or planar sheets

1028    user
1028    Current as a function of position is not allowed. Perhaps you want
1028    to try setting functional current density?

1029    user
1029    You are trying to set current density on an invalid entity.
1029    Current density source can only be set on 3d objects

1030    user
1030    A boundary already exists on the entity on which you are trying to
1030    set another boundary. Remove the previous boundary and then try
1030    assigning this one

1031    user
1031    Entity is not a part of any conduction path

1032    user
1032    You are trying to set voltage/current/current-density-terminal on an 
1032	entity. It is not valid because in any conduction path voltage 
1032 	terminals, current terminals and current density terminals cannot 
1032	co-exist with one another.

1033    user
1033    For a conduction path, there cannot be more than one source current
1033    and one sink current

1034    user
1034    Coil terminals and outer terminals cannot co-exist in the same 
1034    conduction path.

1035    user
1035    For any conduction path, there cannot be more than one coil terminal

1036    user
1036    Insulation and voltage boundaries cannot co-exist in a conduction path

1037    user
1037    Multiple sources types (current, current density, voltage) cannot 
1037    co-exist in a conduction path. Setting the chosen source on the entity
1037    violates this.

1038    user
1038    Source and sink current values do not add up to zero in the
1038    conduction path "$$1". Use "Model/Show Conduction Paths" to
1038    view the available conduction paths for current flow.

1039    user
1039    Object "$$1" is an insulator and hence cannot be a part of 
1039    any conduction path (View conduction paths using
1039    Model/Show Conduction Paths)

1040    user
1040    Current/voltage boundary can only be set on faces/sheets 
1040    bordering the region

1041    user
1041    The conduction path on which you are trying to set a 
1041    current/voltage/insulating/current-density-terminal boundary has 
1041	(or would have because of current boundary setting) only one outer 
1041	terminal. So there is only one place where current can flow into 
1041	the region and no place to get out; this would violate Kirchhoff's 
1041	current law and is not allowed.

1042    user
1042    Insulation boundary cannot be set on sheet objects.
1042    Instead use the interface between 2 objects to set the 
1042    insulating boundary.

1043    user
1043    You have specified only one voltage terminal on the conduction path $$1.
1043    At least two voltage terminals must exist per conduction path so the
1043    potential difference can be used in current calculation.

1044    user
1044    Current/Current-density-terminal boundary can only be set on 
1044    faces of 3D objects that border the region or sheet objects. 
1044    It cannot also be set on the region.

1045    user
1045    "Voltage" source can only be applied on outer terminals.
1045    Use "Voltage drop" on coil terminals.

1046    user
1046    "Voltage drop" source cannot be applied on sheet objects
1046    bordering the problem region or the face of a 3d object.

1049    Please choose a different name for the boundary/source.

1050    user
1050    For a valid master or slave boundary, a valid UV-axis has to be
1050    defined

1051    user
1051    A single master boundary can have only a single slave.

1052    user
1052    Function "$$1" is undefined. Use "Model/Functions"
1052    command to assign a value to the above function.

1053    user
1053    Invalid master assigned to slave. Input valid master

1054    user
1054    Master cannot be deleted as it has a slave.
1054    Delete slave and then delete master

1055    user
1055    "Background/Region" cannot be part of any conduction path.
1055    Create an object with the same dimensions as the region
1055    and set the source on it.

1056    user
1056    None of the faces of object "$$1" border the problem region.
1056    Also there are no 2d objects forming the cross-section of 
1056    object "$$1".
1056    In order to set circulating/coil current, you must create a 
1056    2d object forming the cross-section of "$$1" and then
1056    set current on the 2d object.

1057    user
1057    Empty boundary name is not acceptable

1058    user
1058    None of the faces of object "$$1" touch the faces of 
1058    object "$$2".

1059    user
1059    "$$1" direction is not valid.

1060    user
1060    There are no sheet objects forming a cross-section of
1060    the 3d object "$$1". In order for solver to give accurate
1060    solution, current-density objects must have sheet objects
1060    forming their cross-section

1061    user
1061    The value entered for number of points is less than 0.
1061    Number of points must be greater than zero.

1062    user
1062    The E0 and k vectors must be orthogonal.
1062    Please make them so.

1063    user

1064    user
1064    You have aborted the conduction path calculations or
1064    the error checking.

1065    user
1065    You have aborted the error checking. Error check will 
1065    be performed before the solver is invoked.

1066    user
1066    Error message needs to be updated

1067    user
1067    Current density terminal computation has been aborted.
1067    You need to select the current density terminal
1067    from the existing 2d objects.

1068    user
1068    No terminals are picked due to one of the following reasons:
1068        - You have not selected any 3-D solid object
1068        - The terminals for the selected object's conduction path
1068          are already present in the boundary listbox
1068        - You wanted only 2d objects for coil/outer terminals and there
1068          are no such 2d objects

1069   user
1069   Since no excitation has been defined, the problem cannot be solved.

1070   user
1070   If current-density is assigned to any 3d object of a conduction
1070   path then the current-density source needs to be assigned to all the
1070   other 3d objects in that conduction path. Some of the objects
1070   in the conduction path "$$1" are not current-density sources.
1070   Assign current-density source on these objects.
1070   (View conduction paths using "Model/Show Conduction Paths")

1071   user
1071   Error in writing the material/boundary information to the disk.
1071   Some of the possible reasons:
1071        -Out of disk space
1071        -Incorrect boundary/material setup. You may have functions
1071         with the keyword "$$1". If you have such functions, rename these
1071         and don't include "$$1" as a part of the name.

1072   user
1072   Master and Slave geometries don't have the same area.

1073   user
1073   Master and Slave geometries have the same area, but you have 
1073   made an error in creating the UV axis. UV axis for the
1073   slave and the master are used to calculate the transformation 
1073   matrix corresponding to the transformation of slave UV axis 
1073   to the master UV axis. If the slave boundary (it's faces/sheets)
1073   is transformed using this matrix, it should coincide with 
1073   it's master.


1074   user
1074   Encountered error in trying to match master and slave boundaries.
1074   You may have an invalid UV axis definition for either the
1074   master or the slave. Or the transformation of the slave 
1074   UV axis to the master UV axis is not a rigid body 
1074   transformation. Or there is an error in ACIS operations to
1074   transform the slave geometry or boolean the master/slave objects.

1075   user
1075   There are multiple conductors in one or more of your conduction 
1075   paths. The following points must be noted:
1075        -The sheet object or the face used as the source terminal
1075   	     must form an exact cross-section of the current flow
1075         at that location of the conduction path. They cannot 
1075         be smaller or larger.
1075        -You might have forgotten to set the insulation boundary - 
1075         view conduction paths using "Model/Show Conduction Paths" 
1075         to ensure that the conduction paths represent your
1075         expectations.

1076   user
1076   There is an overlap between 2 faces having different
1076   boundaries ("$$1","$$2"). In the area of the overlap, the rule
1076   followed is: Latter boundaries override the former except 
1076   in the case of terminals and ports. Terminals and Ports
1076   created initially cannot be overridden unless you clear
1076   these. Note that the boundary listbox indicates the order 
1076   in which boundaries got created.

1077    user
1077    The current mouse position is not the vertex of a body.
1077    Pick a vertex in the "Vertex Snap" mode and proceed.
1077    If the face/sheet on which you are setting the master/slave
1077    boundary doesn't have any vertex, then create 
1077    rectangular sheet objects on both the master and the slave.
1077    Use the vertices of these sheets to set the origin,
1077    U and V points.

1078    user
1078    String "$$1" can neither be a number or a functional value.
1078    Functions must start with a letter and could only have characters
1078    belonging to the character set:
1078    "$$2". 
1078    While numbers must start with a digit and could only have 
1078    characters belonging to the character set "$$3".

1079    user

1153	user
1153	The $$1 point of the current flow line does not lie in the plane
1153    of the selected face.

1154	user
1154	The $$1 point of the current flow line does not lie on the
1154    selected face.

1155    user
1155    $$1 cannot be less than or equal to 0.  If you want to use a
1155	zero value, consider using a perfect E boundary instead.

1156    user
1156    $$1 cannot be less than 0.

1157	user
1157	A lumped RLC boundary must have a value for at least one of
1157	resistance, inductance, or capacitance.

1158    user
1158    If you want to use a zero value for capacitance without also
1158	specifying a value for either resistance or inductance, consider 
1158	using a perfect H boundary instead.

1159	user
1159	When terminals are defined, no two terminals on a port may have the
1159	same terminal voltage line definition, as these lines are used.

1160	user
1160	Terminal names must be unique for all modes on a port.

1161	user
1161	The terminal name for "mode $$1" must have no more than 8 characters 
1161	and no embedded blanks.

1162	user
1162	Port names may contain no more than 8 characters.

1163	user
1163	When terminals are defined, each port must have voltage lines
1163	defined for all of its terminals.

1164	user
1164	If the theta or phi angle has the same start and stop, you must
1164	specify 1 as the number of points.

1165 	user
1165 	The problem is not well defined.
1165 	At least on of the following conditions must be 
1165 	specified: a voltage source, a voltage boundary,
1165 	or an odd symmetry boundary.

1166 	user
1166	All current terminals defined in a conduction path should either be
1166	"solid" or "stranded".

1167	user
1167	For every conduction path with current density sources defined,
1167	there should be either at least one internal current density terminal
1167	(for closed loops) or at least two outer current density terminals 
1167	defined.

1168	user
1168	You have defined current density terminals without defining current 
1168	density sources in the conduction path.

1169	user
1169	You have set "stranded" current terminals. This setting will override
1169	any "eddy effect" and "displacement current" settings for all objects
1169    in "stranded" conduction path(s). "Eddy effect" and "displacement 
1169    current" will be turned off automatically in these objects during solve,
1169    regardless of what the "eddy effect" panel shows for these objects.

1170    user
1170    "$$1" as a function of position or temperature is not allowed.

1171    user
1171    "$$1" as a function of position and temperature is not allowed.

1172    user
1172    "$$1" as a function of temperature is not allowed.

1173 	user
1173 	The problem is ill-defined. You must specify at least one of the
1173 	following conditions: a temperature source, temperature boundary, 
1173 	conduction/radiation boundary, heat transfer boundary, or an even
1173 	symmetry boundary. 

1174    user
1174    The exponent can not be less than 0 or greater than 1.

1175    user
1175    The terminal winding is not completely set up.

1176    user
1176    Cannot set infinite ground plane boundary at the object-object 
1176    interface.

1177    user
1177    Cannot set infinite ground plane boundary on non-planar entities.

1178    user
1178    Infinite ground plane  boundary must lie at the edge of the 
1178    problem region.

1179    user
1179    The function defining the total current in a "current source"
1179    cannot depend on time. You can define current as a function
1179    of time by creating a winding and using a function for the
1179    winding current.

1180    user
1180    The function defining the current density in a "current density source"
1180    cannot depend on time. 

1181    user
1181    Coil terminals cannot be defined on or inside the perfect conductor.
