1071 Object "$$1" failed in ACIS entity checks.
1071 $$2.

1072 user
1072 Object "$$1" is non-manifold. It may have one or more of the 
1072 following properties:
1072
1072 - Mixed Dimensionality
1072   The object is a combination of solid, sheet, and/or wire parts.
1072

1072   The object makes contact with itself at either a point or an edge.

1072 

1073 user

1074 user
1074 Highlighted objects extend beyond or touch defined problem region.

1075 user
1075 One or more of the faces selected for uncovering would have
1075 generated an object that is a combination of polylines and sheets
1075 or polylines and solid bodies.  This type of combination entity is
1075 not permitted.  Those faces have not been uncovered.  You may want
1075 to use the Detach Faces command to separate the faces from the
1075 original object before uncovering them.

1076 user
1076 Sheet objects and Solid objects cannot be united.

1077 user
1077 Sheet objects and Solid objects cannot be subtracted.

1080 user
1080 The selected polyline or sheet is too complex for editing.
1080 Please simplify the object and try again.

1081 Please specify a valid object name and try again.

1100 user
1100 A sheet used for sweeping along a path with a twist must be a

1101 A path used for sweeping along a path with a twist must be
1101 smooth (i.e. it cannot contain sharp bends).

1102 user
1102 Axis value can only be 0(X axis) or 1(Y axis) or 2(Z axis).

1103 user
1103 Radius value cannot be less than $$1. Either the input radius
1103 is too small or the axis of $$2 is incorrectly chosen.

1104 user
1104 Arc command failed. Either the radius of the arc is too small
1104 or the end position chosen is at the center of the circle.

1105 user
1105 Incorrect format input for the end position or the angle of the
1105 arc. Correct format is either a single numeric or a 3D position 
1105 enclosed in quotes, e.g. "90" or "[0, 12, 12]".

1106 user
1106 Make arc command failed. Acis problem: $$1

1107 user

1111   2. Disk quota exceeded.
1111   3. File or directory is write protected.

1112 user
1112 The defined region is too big, and may cause 
1112 errors due to tolerance limitations.

1113 user
1113 Invalid box with zero size specified.

1114 user
1114 The 3D problem region is not valid.
1114 This region is used to determine the 
1114 drawing size for the exported 2D model. 
1114 Use the Options/Region commands to create
1114 a valid 3D region.

1115 user
1115 Units too small.
1115 The unit chosen to display the geometry is very small. For example, 
1115 it is better to denote an object 50000 microns long as 50 mm long. 
1115 Please use Options/units menu item to redisplay your geometry in more 
1115 appropriate units.

1116 user
1116 Units too big.
1116 The unit chosen to display the geometry is very large. For example, 
1116 it is better to denote an object 0.0001 meters long as 100 microns long. 
1116 Please use Options/units menu item to redisplay your geometry in more 
1116 appropriate units.

1117 user
1117 Non unique body/face ids detected.
1117 These ids are internal data used by Ansoft to map materials and boundary
1117 conditions to model objects and faces. Non unique ids get generated when
1117 very unusual sequence of operations are performed in the modeler. 
1117 Regrettably, due to the uncertainity all the boundary and material
1117 assignments have to be cleared.

1118 user
1118 Distance must not be zero.

1119 user
1119 The attempt to move faces of object "$$1" has failed.
1119 Problem: $$2
1119 Please check the offset, the vector or the object.

1120 user
1120 New surface of "$$1" is beyond boundary.

1121 user
1121 Offsetting "$$1" is failed.
1121 Problem: $$2
1121 Please check the offset or the object.
