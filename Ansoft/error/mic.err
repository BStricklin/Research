1012	first.

1013	fatal
1013	Cannot find the proper edge for the tetrahedron
1013	face. The probable cause is that the problem has

1026	Please use the Post Field menu item to select the field
1026	for post processing.

1027    fatal
1027    Port boundaries contain 2-D resistors which are not
1027    supported for this version of $$1.

1028    user
1028    There are no multiple port solutions available for this
1028    problem. The actual field data is missing and no post
1028	processing will be possible.

1029    user
1029    There are no multiple port solutions available for this
1029    problem. This problem has been solved using an earlier
1029	version of $$1 which only saved the dominant mode on port 1.

1030    user
1030    The multiple port solution data for this problem has been
1030    corrupted. No post processing will be possible.

1034	The boundary $$1 does not exist in the list of
1034	defined boundaries. The boundary information is
1034	inconsistent. The boundary information must be
1034	deleted and reentered.

1035    fatal
1035    There are no boundaries to define $$1 correctly.
1035    This may be due to incorrect material definitions for
1035    those objects that make up the port surface. Please
1035    verify the material properties in the MATERIALS MENU.

1100    fatal
1100    Insufficient memory for module $$1.

1101	user
1101	There are no tetrahedral faces assigned to 
1101	boundary $$1. Since boundary operations are 
1101	order dependent, please check to make certain that 
1101	this boundary is not being ignored because of other 
1101	operations on the same surfaces. It is recommended that
1101	you redefine the boundary in question.

1102	fatal
1102	One of the faces which define this port has two
1102	identical points. Please check your solid data 
1102	file for any errors which might cause this
1102	problem.

1103	user
1103	The X server on which you are running $$1 does
1103	not support animated plots.  To view animated 
1103 	plots you must display your $$1 windows on a 
1103 	workstation running an X server from a different 
1103 	vendor.

1108	fatal
1108	Unable to find the executable `$$1'.

1109    user
1109    Can not compute radiated fields because the structure 
1109    does not contain any radiation boundaries.

1110    fatal
1110    Unable to change the current directory to $$1.

1112	fatal
1112	Can not solve $$1 2D.  Anisotropic material 
1112	$$2 has different principal axis for mu and epsilon.

1113	fatal
1113	Anisotropic material principal axis on '$$1'
1113	must align with the port normal.

1114	impedance/radiation boundary in this version of $$2.

1115	fatal

1117	material '$$2' on the port.

1118	user
1118	There are no tetrahedral faces assigned to 
1118	port $$1. Since boundary operations are order dependent,
1118	please check to make certain that this boundary is not
1118	being ignored because of other operations on the same
1118	surfaces.

1119	user
1119	The matrix solver failed ($$1).
1119    This may be due to a lack of disk space.

1120    fatal
1120    Error in Magnetostatic data, tetrahedral centroid
1120    data not found in magnetostatic file.

1121    fatal
1121    Mismatch in the number of triangles between
1121    2D and 3D port definition.  Probable cause is
1121    wave added triangles after 3D mesh was generated.

1122    user
1122    $$1 mode $$2 crosses cut-off in the specified fast sweep
1122    range.  Consider splitting the sweep into multiple ranges.
1122    Use a port discrete sweep to locate the cut-off frequency.

1123    fatal
1123    $$1 slave boundary has a phase shift that is
1123    incompatible with fast sweep.  Modify the
1123    phase shift or use discrete sweep.

1124    fatal
1124    $$1 slave boundary is a scan angle type.  The fast sweep
1124    does not currently support that boundary condition.

1125    fatal
1125	The triangulations on $$1 are different in 2d than 3d.
1125	Revisit solve set up to verify the correct mesh is selected.

1126    fatal
1126	$$1 is incorrectly set up.  A port must have a non-existent
1126	material on one side.  Both $$2 and $$3 exist.

1127    fatal
1127    Error in finite element matrix generation.
1127    $$1
1127    Possible causes are internal code failure or
1127    an invalid model has been created.

1128    fatal
1128	$$1 is incorrectly set up.  A gap source will be short circuited
1128    by conductors

1129	fatal
1129	an unexpected port type

1130	fatal
1130	Inconsistent hydra ids on a half_face of port $$1

1131	fatal
1131	Problem with mode alignment on port $$1,
1131    Possible casues are:
1131        - Inappropriate terminal line setup
1131        - Port files I/O difficulty

1200	user
1200	Write Failure in module $$1. 2 Possible causes are:
1200	1. Disk space full.
1200	2. Disk quota exceeded.
1200	All temporary files have been deleted and normal disk
1200	space has been restored. Previous solution retained.

1201    user
1201    The specified frequency is 
1201    outside the fast sweep range.

1202    user
1202    There is a discrepancy in the number of degrees 
1202    of freedom.  Most likely caused by post processing
1202    a project with a different setting of ZERO_ORDER
1202    from the setting it was solved with.
