2053	user
2053	Manual mesh has not yet been run for this project, and is not
2053	supported in your setup until you run it.  This situation likely
2053	arose from copying a project model-only, which does not copy the

2056	user
2056	You must request at least one and no more than 20 eigenmodes.

2057	user
2057	You must specify a positive value for the minimum eigenmode

2064	user

2065	user
2065	You have changed the start frequency, stop frequency, and/or
2065    the number of steps.  These are inconsistent with previously
2065    defined explicit sweep frequencies.  Do you want to revert to
2065	the default frequency distribution or continue using the current
2065	explicit frequencies?

2066	user
2066	The number of discrete frequency values supplied is not sufficient.

2067	user
2067	The discrete frequencies must all be distinct.

2068	user

2069	The field solution is saved only for the last frequency in a
2069	discrete sweep or the last interpolating frequency in an interpolating
2069	sweep.  Since your problem does not have any ports, solution data 
2069	for all but this frequency will be discarded.  If this is your 
2069	intent, please request a single frequency solution instead.

2070	user
2070	No eigenmode solution of the specified type was found.

2071	user
2071	The mesh computed at the adaptive frequency may not be dense enough 
2071	to generate an accurate solution at higher frequencies in the sweep 
2071	range.  Consider increasing the adaptive frequency to at least
2071	0.5 times the high end frequency.  
2071
2071	Do you want to proceed anyway?

2072	user
2072	The selected fast sweep frequency range will likely result in
2072	low accuracy near the upper and lower ends of the range.  Accuracy 
2072	will be improved if you split it up into multiple fast sweeps.  
2072	Consider using one sweep from $$1 to $$2 GHz and a second sweep 
2072	from $$3 to $$4 GHz.
2072
2072	Do you want to proceed anyway?

2073	user
2073	You must specify a parametric variable name.

2074	user
2074	The parametric variable name must be unique.

2075	user
2075	You must define at least one parametric variable.

2079	user
2079	Filter cost function can be setup only if a frequency sweep
2079	is chosen.

2080	user
2080	Frequency values cannot be negative.

2081	user
2081	As a consequence of problem setup changes that were made,
2081	it was necessary to delete some of your parametric variable 
2081	definitions, which no longer contained valid problem references.

2082 user
2082 The standard outputs that you can setup are circuit parameters.
2082 Circuit parameters can only be extracted from projects that
2082 have ports. You have not defined ports in this project. To
2082 extract other data, you need to write custom macro files.

2083	user
2083	You must select at least one S-matrix entry for the plotting.

2084	user
2084	The error tolerance for the interpolating sweep must be positive and 
2084	no larger than 2 percent.

2085	user
2085	The maximum number of solutions for the interpolating sweep must
2085	be greater than 1.

2086	user
2086	The number of sweep steps requested may result in fewer solutions
2086	than required for the interpolating sweep.  You should either use 
2086	a discrete (non interpolating) sweep or increase the requested 
2086	number of sweep steps.

2087 user
2087 Cannot convert reference curve to db. Function value(s) must be positive.

2088	user
2088	The fast sweep circuit parameters could not be approximated
2088	well.  Corrective action will likely consist of one of the
2088	following possibilities: 
2088
2088		Further refine the mesh.
2088		Narrow the fast sweep frequency range.
2088		Switch to an interpolating sweep.

2089	user
2089	The terminal voltage lines that were entered in the boundary manager
2089	for one or more ports resulted in a singular voltage transformation
2089	that cannot be used to produce reliable terminal quantities for the
2089	current solution.  If you proceed, the terminal quantities may not
2089	be useful.
2089	
2089	Possible causes of this problem are that one or more lines may have
2089	been defined along the edge of a perfect conductor, or multiple lines
2089	may connect the ground reference to a signal line.
2089
2089	Do you want to proceed, using the terminal voltage lines as defined?

2090	user
2090	The terminal voltage lines that were entered in the boundary
2090	manager for one or more ports resulted in a singular voltage
2090	transformation that cannot be used to produce reliable
2090	terminal quantities for the current solution.
2090	
2090	Possible causes of this problem are that one or more lines
2090	may have been defined along the edge of a perfect conductor,
2090	or multiple lines may connect the ground reference to a
2090	signal line.
2090
2090	Prior to doing any further solutions, please edit the 
2090	terminal lines.
2090

2091	user
2091	The interpolating sweep did not converge.  Attempting one or
2091	more of the following may yield better approximated results:
2091
2091		1. Increase the maximum number of solutions for the
2091		   interpolating sweep.  This will allow more 
2091		   solutions supporting the interpolation, with 
2091		   resulting increased accuracy.
2091
2091		2. Reduce the frequency range for the sweep.  This 
2091		   may exclude problem regions where the circuit 
2091		   parameters are volatile and cause interpolation 
2091		   inaccuracy.
2091
2091		3. Do further mesh refinement by requesting 
2091		   additional adaptive passes before redoing the 
2091		   interpolating sweep.  This may reduce finite 
2091		   element approximation error that distorts the
2091		   results.
2091

2092	user
2092	The sweep parameters you specified would result in too large 
2092	a number of frequency steps.  The maximum number of steps
2092	is 9999.  You can reduce the number of steps by one of the
2092	following actions:
2092
2092		1. Reduce the impulse response duration.
2092
2092		2. Make the signal rise time longer.
2092
2092		3. Reduce the number of time steps during the rise time.
2092
2092	Do you want to remain in this panel in order to correct the
2092	sweep parameter settings?
2092

2093	user
2093	The sweep parameters you specified would result in too small 
2093	a number of frequency steps.  The minimum recommended number of
2093	steps is 100.  You can increase the number of steps by one of the
2093	following actions:
2093
2093		1. Increase the impulse response duration.
2093
2093		2. Make the signal rise time shorter.
2093
2093		3. Increase the number of time steps during the rise time.
2093
2093	Do you want to remain in this panel in order to correct the
2093	sweep parameter settings?
2093

2094	user
2094	The sweep parameters you specified resulted in a maximum frequency
2094	greater than 100 GHz or less than 1 MHz.  Do you want to proceed?

2095	user
2095	There is at least one port for which you specified that not all modes 
2095	should be saved.  This will prevent you from setting the terminal
2095	form of excitations when viewing fields in the field post processor.
2095	If you do want to excite fields in this way, you should save all
2095	modes instead.
2095
2095	Do you want to proceed?

2096	user
2096	The number of time points must be at least 10,
2096	and there must be at least one time step per rise.

2097	user
2097	With a ports only solution, you must select either a single
2097	frequency or a sweep.

2098	user
2098	If you plan on both de-embedding and renormalizing a structure,
2098	you should de-embed the solution first, because de-embedding a
2098	renormalized solution will produce inaccurate results.
2098
2098	Do you still want to continue?
