1000  Died unexpectedly.
1000  Possible reasons:
1000   (1) singular matrix due to improper problem setup
1000   (2) Unknown error

1002 user
1002 Some (or all) mesh files are missing.
1002 Please create a mesh and save the files.

1003 user
1003 To perform this operation you must have a
1003 vector in the top register of the calculator.

1004 user
1004 Material attributes are not set yet.

1005 user
1005 Some inline function, or B-H curve, is not available.

1006 user
1006 This operation requires a solved problem.  Please
1006 solve the problem or retrieve the solution files.

1007 user
1007 No 2d object can be used as a current
1007 terminal for "$$1".  Please make sure
1007 "$$1" is a part of a conduction path,
1007 or return to the solid modeler and
1007 add a 2d solid(s) to use as a terminal(s).

1008 user
1008 There are no terminal named "$$1."

1009 user
1009 There is only one outer terminal which borders the
1009 conductor "$$1," and that outer terminal may also
1009 touch other 3d object(s).
1009   (1) If you forgot to create the second terminal 
1009       (2d object), please go back to the solid
1009        modeler and add one more 2d object.
1009   (2) If "$$1" is only a portion of a conduction path,
1009       you may continue to set terminal current.
1009       Be aware that you need other outer terminal(s) 
1009       to allow the current to flow out of (or into) this 
1009       conduction path.
1009   (3) The current at the terminal flows into all
1009       touched 3d objects.  Hence, all the touched
1009       objects have to be set to "Source-Current Yes"
1009       when you go through Material setup.
1009 You can continue to set terminal currents.

1010 fatal
1010 File system unable to create "$$1."

1011 fatal
1011 File system unable to read "$$1."

1012 user
1012 There are two outer terminals which border the
1012 conductor "$$1."  One (or two) of the terminals
1012 may touch 3d object(s) other than "$$1."
1012 Be aware that the current at the terminal
1012 flows into all touched 3d objects.  Hence, 
1012 all the touched 3d objects have to be set to 
1012 "Source-Current Yes" when you go through Material
1012 setup. 
1012 You can continue to set terminal currents.

1013 fatal
1013 Message not available 

1014 fatal
1014 The solid file is corrupted.

1015 user
1015 Terminal "$$1" is not attached to a conductor.

1017 user
1017 There are more than two outer terminals
1017 attached to this 3d object. To avoid
1017 confusions, please go back to the solid 
1017 modeler and reset your 2d objects.

1018 user
1018 There is only one outer terminal which borders the
1018 conductor "$$1." 
1018   (1) If you forgot to create the second terminal 
1018       (2d object), please go back to the solid
1018        modeler and add one more 2d object.
1018   (2) If "$$1" is only a portion of a conduction path,
1018       you can continue to use that terminal to specify
1018       the total current flowing into (or out of) this
1018       conduction path.  Be aware that you need other
1018       outer terminal(s) to allow the current to 
1018       flow out of (or into) this conduction path.
1018 You can continue to set terminal current.

1019 user
1019 Electric current source is required for 
1019 inductance computation.  Please go back to
1019 solid modeler and change the voltage source to 
1019 a current source for the conductor "$$1."

1020 user
1020 Matching boundary is not set properly.  Either plane or 
1020 a function does not exist.  Please set your boundary again.

1021 user
1021 You have not selected all the necessary options to generate
1021 a plot.  Please check your settings and try again.

1022 user
1022 Material conductivity has not been set properly.
1022 You have to assign nonzero conductivity to this
1022 object because it has been picked as a source 
1022 and/or eddy region.

1023 user
1023 Illegal blank space in the file name. 

1024 user
1024 BH curve file name cannot start with a number.

1025 user
1025 Unable to write out BH curve to $$1,
1025 defaulting to current directory.

1027 fatal
1027 Problem cannot be solved, because 
1027 no excitation has been defined.

1028 user
1028 There may be a terminal which touches 3d objects 
1028 other than "$$1." Please make sure this is what
1028 you wanted to model. 
1028 Be aware that the current at the terminal
1028 flows into all touched 3d objects.  Hence, 
1028 all the touched 3d objects have to be set to
1028 "Current Source Yes" when you go through Material
1028  setup. 
1028 You can continue to set terminal current.

1036 user
1036 Unable to compute matrix.
1036 Possible reasons:

1036         a 2d object (only 3d objects can be used in the matrix)
1036     (2) At least one of the objects is not assigned as an
1036         electric CURRENT source.
1036		-it's assigned a current-density or voltage(s)
1036	         instead of total current OR
1036		-there are multiple objects in the conduction path
1036             and the object you've selected doesn't include
