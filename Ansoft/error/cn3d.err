1000 fatal
1000  Died unexpectedly.
1000  Possible reasons:
1000   (1) singular matrix due to improper problem setup
1000   (2) Unknown error

1001 fatal
1001  Module $$1 died unexpectedly.
1001  Possible reasons:
1001   (1) insufficient disk space
1001   (2) singular matrix due to improper
1001       problem setup

1002 user
1002 Some (or all) mesh files are missing.
1002 Please create a mesh and save the files.

1003 user
1003 To perform this operation you must have a
1003 vector in the top register of the calculator.

1004 user
1004 Material attributes are not set yet.

1005 user
1005 Some inline function is not available.

1006 user
1006 This operation requires a solved problem.  Please
1006 solve the problem or retrieve the solution files.

1008 user
1008 All objects are defined as perfect conductors; so there is no
1008 interior electric field.  Please correct this condition
1008 by redefining material attributes.

1009 user
1009 Plane "$$1" does not exist. Enter the plane now.

1010 user
1010 You need two planes to set matching boundaries.
1010 Please define proper planes.

1011 user
1011 Inline function "$$1" is not available. 
1011 Enter the function now.

1012 user
1012 Matching boundary is not set properly.  Either a plane or 
1012 a function does not exist.  Please set your boundary again.

1013 user
1013 You have not selected all the necessary options to generate
1013 a plot.  Please check your settings and try again.

1014 fatal
1014 Problem cannot be solved because
1014 no excitation has been defined.

1015 fatal
1015 To use object "$$1" as a valid terminal for resistance matrix
1015 calculation, you need to specify it as a perfect conductor with
1015 given voltage. Please go back to set material attributes again.

1016 fatal
1016 Insulation sheet can not be used for
1016 conduction path involving voltage source.
1016 Please set up your problem again.

1017 fatal
1017 Unable to find match point for 
1017 matching boundary.
1017 Please check problem setup.

1018 fatal
1018 Unable to find match edge for
1018 matching boundary.
1018 Please check problem setup.

1019 fatal
1019 There are holes in conductor "$$1". In order
1019 to solve, you need a surrounding box or object.
1019 Internal software error.

1020 fatal
1020 Cannot have voltage terminal on 
1020 matching boundary.  Please set
1020 your problem again.

1021 fatal
1021 Problem cannot be solved due to
1021 improper setup.

1034 fatal
1034 Unable to create file "$$1" in your project
1034 directory.  Check the computer file system
1034 status please.

1035 fatal
1035 Unable to find the file "$$1" in your directory.
1035 This file contains the results of matrix solving.

1036 fatal
1036 Problem cannot be solved due to
1036 improper geometry or source setup.

1037 fatal
1037 Some Conductor has more than one sink terminal.

1038 fatal
1038 Some conductor has no sink terminal.

1039 fatal
1039 "$$1" is not a source terminal.

1040 fatal
1040 Incorrect terminal setup on at least one conductor.
1040 Possibilities:
1040   (1) mixed current and voltage terminals.
1040   (2) more than one sink current terminal.
1040   (3) either no sink or no source terminal.
1040   (4) overlapping terminals.

1043    fatal
1043    There is no license for module $$1.

1044 fatal
1044 Unable to find hydra due to
1044 improper terminal setup.


1100    fatal
1100    Insufficient memory or some other internal error for module $$1.

1200    fatal
1200    Error in writing file.
1200    Possible causes are:
1200       - Out of disk space.
1200       - No file access privileges.
1200       - Network or hardware problems.

1201 fatal
1201 Negative mind is detected.

1202 fatal
1202 No objects are included in solution region.

1204 fatal
1204 Unable to finish the solution.
1204 Please check the problem setup.

1205 fatal
1205 No unknowns to solve
1205 Please use manual mesh and try again.
 
1206 fatal
1206 Cannot find tangential vector
 
1207 fatal
