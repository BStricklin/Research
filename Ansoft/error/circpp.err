2147	The sweep you selected to export has a minimum frequency
2147	that is too high to provide sufficient detail in the exported
2147	data.  The suggested remedy is to first re-solve the sweep
2147	with a minimum frequency of no greater than $$1 GHz.
2147
2147	Do you want to proceed with the export as requested?

2148	user
2148	The export filename for Maxwell Spice must be lower case.
