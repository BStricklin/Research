1018       you may continue to set current or voltage on
1018       the terminal. Be aware that you need other
1018       outer terminal(s) to allow current to flow
1018       out of (or into) that conduction path.

1019 user
1019 Electric current source is required for

1036 your problem again.

1037 user
1037 There is only one outer terminal which borders 
1037 the conductor "$$1."  
1037   (1) If you forgot to create the second terminal 
1037       (2d object), please go back to the solid 
1037       modeler and add one more 2d object.
1037   (2) If "$$1" is only a portion of a conduction path,
1037       you may continue to set current or voltage
1037       on the terminal.
1037   (3) The current at "$$1" flows into all touched 
1037       3d objects.  Hence all the touched objects have
1037       to be set to "Source-Current Yes" when you go
1037       through Material setup.  Be aware that you need
1037       other outer terminal(s) to allow current
1037       to flow out of (or into) that conduction path.

1038 user
1038 There are two outer terminals which border the
1038 conductor "$$1."  One (or two) of the terminals
1038 may touch 3d object(s) other than "$$1."
1038 Be aware that the current at the terminal
1038 flows into all touched 3d objects.  Hence,
1038 all the touched 3d objects have to be set to
1038 "Source-Current Yes" when you go through Material
1038 setup.
1038 You can continue to set terminals.

1039 user
1039 There are more than two outer terminals which 
1039 border the conductor "$$1."  At least one of the
1039 terminals may touch 3d object(s) other than "$$1."
1039 Be aware that the current at that terminal flows
1039 into all touched 3d objects.  Hence all the 
1039 touched 3d objects have to be set to "Source-
1039 Current Yes" when you go through Material setup.

1040 user
1040 One of the terminals on the terminal list (as
1040 you will see when you proceed) may touch
1040 3d object(s) other than "$$1."  Be aware 
1040 that the current at that terminal flows
1040 into all touched 3d objects.  Hence all the 
1040 touched 3d objects have to be set to "Source-
1040 Current Yes" when you go through Material setup.

1041 user
1041 Unable to compute matrix.
1041 Possible reasons:
1041     (1) At least one of the objects in the matrix setup is 
1041         a 2d object (only 3d objects can be used in the matrix)
1041     (2) At least one of the objects is not assigned as an
1041         electric CURRENT source.
1041		-there are multiple objects in the conduction path
1041             and the object you've selected doesn't include 
1041             the source 

1042 fatal
1042 The conduction solver does not currently support functional conductivity.
1042 The program will not be able to generate a conduction solution for this
1042 problem.
1042 Note that you can still obtain a magnetostatic solution and use that
1042 solution to view the current density ( J = curl H ).

1043    fatal
1043    There is no license for module $$1.

1044    user

3006 ends in a non-conducting object instead of the problem space.

3007 fatal
3007 There is no path for current to flow.
3007 Please check either the source/sink
3007 assignments or the model itself.
