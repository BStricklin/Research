2080	user
2080	Solve Surface cannot be used with an anisotropic material assignment.

2081	user
2081	Applying "Solve Surface" to this object will cause the fields to be
2081	modeled using a surface impedance approximation on the object's
2081	faces.  Objects contained within this one will be electrically
2081	isolated from those outside.
2081	To allow fields to fully penetrate the object, choose "Solve Inside".

2081	objects, delete the outer object and apply a conductivity boundary
2081	to the surface of the inner objects.

2090	a different material or alternate assignment angle specifications.

2091	user
2091	You have attempted to include one or more objects that are currently
2091	assigned to perfect insulators.  In order to include these objects,
2091	first change the assigned materials.  To view the assigned material

2095	all be treated uniformly, with regard to PML thickness and 
2095	local coordinate system orientation.

2096	user
2096	The chosen combination is not valid for one of the following reasons:
2096
2096	a) In order to set up PML material behavior for model objects that
2096	   were drawn using the PMLCoverSetup macro, you are restricted to
2096	   terminating these objects with free space, or
2096
2096	b) If you have directly drawn an object for transmission line

2104	user
2104	The currently selected material cannot be used for PML computations
2104	and material assignments to directly drawn objects in the model,
2104	because it is not anisotropic.  Please note that this material
2104	would be modified if the PMLMatSetup macro were to complete normally.

2105	user
2105	One or more of the reserved name materials PMLx, PMLy, PMLz,
2105	PMLxy, PMLxz, PMLyz, PMLxyz has been deleted.  You cannot use the
2105	PMLMatSetup macro for automatically created PML objects until
2105	you first use Material/Clear to remove those reserved materials
2105	that remain.  This will enable the PMLMatSetup macro to 
2105	initialize them all properly.

2106	user
2106	The material property for $$1 in $$2 has an illegal functional
2106	value, because it makes use of unsupported intrinsic variables.

2112	user
2112	Any material with a conductivity greater than zero and less than $$1
