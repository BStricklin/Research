1076	user
1076	Two points should be noted regarding custom radiation surfaces:
1076	   1)Custom radiation surface must surround all sources. 
1076	   2)The direction of radiation is taken as the direction of the
1076	     outward normals of the picked faces of objects. So for the
1076	     surface you have chosen, the direction will be pointing
1076	     out of the object(s): $$1

1079	Animation being plotted in the active view window will
1079	overlap with an existing plot "$$1" in this same window.

1080	user
1080	Animation plot "$$1" does not depend on any variable. You migh
1080	have edited the sources and chose not to modify this
