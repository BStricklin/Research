1246    user
1246    One of "Solve fields" or "Solve parameters" must be chosen.

1247    fatal
1247    Error in reading solution parameters. Error code is $$1,
1247    Last read keyword = $$2.

1248    user
1248    Field solution does not exist for the current mesh.
1248    Choose "Solve for fields" through 
1248    "Setup solution parameters..." and then resume solving.

1249    fatal
1249    Meshes (fileset1 or fileset2) do not exist. Impossible to
1249    solve non-adaptively.

1250    fatal
1250    Initial mesh copy failed either due to insufficient disk space
1250    or the initial mesh does not exist.

1251    user

1254    The current mouse position is not the vertex of a body.
1254    Pick a vertex in the "Vertex Snap" mode and proceed.
1254    If the face/sheet on which you are setting the master/slave
1254    boundary doesn't have any vertex, then create 
1254    rectangular sheet objects on both the master and the slave.
1254    Use the vertices of these sheets to set the origin,
1254    U and V points.

1255    fatal
1255    Feature Not Yet Implemented in module $$1.

1256    fatal
1256    Incomplete setup for $$1 solution.

1257    user
1257    The Problem has a converged solution.
1257    Please check the solution parameters.

1258    user
1258    Additional passes requested is set to 0.
1258    Please edit the solution parameters and 
1258    specify the number of passes requested.

1267    user
1267    The current field solution on disk is from the frequency 
1267    different from the current frequency.
1267    Cannot use this solution to compute parameters.

1268    user
1268    Cannot compute lorentz force/torque on perfectly
1268    conducting objects

1269    user
1269    Cannot display solver attributes because there is no initial
1269    mesh. Create initial mesh either by choosing the manual mesh
1269    option or performing a solution.

1270	Error reading the $$1 file. 

1271 user
1271 Project does not have any field solution.

1272 user
1272 No executive parameters (force, torque or matrix setups) have
1272 been defined for this project so there is nothing to add to the 
1272 parametric analysis. 
1272 If you want to define some executive parameters, first return to 
1272 "Nominal Project/Edit/View..." in modify mode; setup the force,
1272 torque or matrix that you want to solve. Then you can select
1272 which parameters will be calculated during the Optimetrics run
1272 through "Post Process/Create Executive Parameters Macro ...".

1273 Changing the solution frequency will invalidate the accuracy of 
1273 the solution for the nominal and parametric problem.
1273 Do you want to proceed?

1274 Changing the solution frequency will invalidate the accuracy of 
1274 the solution for the nominal problem.
1274 Do you want to proceed?

1275 Changing the solution frequency will invalidate the accuracy of 
1275 the solution for the parametric problem.
1275 Do you want to proceed?

1276 The internal variable table in Maxwell 3D does not support 
1276 thermal, coupled-thermal, or transient problem types. To do
1276 parametric sweeps on these types of problems you must use the
1276 optional Optimetrics module.
