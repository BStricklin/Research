1001    Unable to contact `$$1' ($$2).

1002	fatal
1002	Internal software error in $$1.

1003	user
1003	The selected process is already running, it cannot be modified.

1015	user

1015	Please classify it with the Project Manager.

1016	user
1016	Unable to determine the project type of `$$1', please classify
1016	it with the Project Manager.

1017	user
1017	There are no hosts configured for scheduling, please run the
1017	process manager and do so.

1018	user
1018	No hosts configured and unable to determine IP address of host `$$1'.

1019	user
1019	Error submitting job. This is most likely due to
1019	a lack of write permission for the queue file for
1019	`$$1'.  Please verify that you have permission
1019	to write to the directory:
1019	
1019	  $$2
1019	
1019	and the file under it:
1019	
1019	   $$3

1020	user
1020	The process manager is unable to contact the process daemon
1020	for host `$$1'. There is another daemon using the same port
1020	number ($$2) as is currently configured for the process
1020	manager.
1020
1020	One way to fix this problem is to configure the process
1020	manager to use a different port. This can be done by adding
1020	an entry for `procmgr' in /etc/services.

1021	user
1021	The process manager, after making an initial connection to
1021	a daemon on port `$$2' (port $$1), was unable to get
1021	a response back (timed out after $$3 seconds).
1021	
1021	Most likely this is caused by another daemon using the port
1021	configured for the process manager. If this is the case, the
1021	port number for the process manager can be changed by adding
1021	an entry for `procmgr' in /etc/services.
1021	
1021	It is also possible that your network is just really slow.
1021	To work around this, you can change the default timeout to
1021	something more reasonable for your network.
