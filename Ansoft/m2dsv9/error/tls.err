1039    fatal
1039    Improper solve setup. Select either "Solve fields",
1039    "Solve parameters", "Solve Sweep" or any combination
1039    of them.

1040    user
1040    Cannot do fast sweep.  Complex sheet sources and complex 
1040    source densities are not yet supported by fast sweep. 

1041    user
1041    Cannot do fast sweep.  Non-zero value boundaries, and 
1041    functional value boundaries, are not yet supported by 
1041    fast sweep.

1042    user
1042    Cannot do fast sweep.  Fast sweep does not support impedance 
1042    boundary conditions yet.

1043    user
1043    Cannot do a frequency sweep (fast or slow.)  
1043
1043    You have set up a completely lossless problem.  The result 
1043    will be independent of frequency, so there's no point to 
1043    doing a sweep.  Possible causes:
1043      - all conductors are "perfect_conductor"
1043      - all conductors are "stranded"
1043      - a mix of the above

1044    fatal
1044    Improper solve setup. Select either "Solve fields",
1044    "Solve parameters", "Solve Transient" or any combination
1044    of them.

1045	Cannot export $$1 matrix

1046 	user
1046	No matrix to export

1047	user
1047	Cannot open file for export
	
1100	user	
1100    Error in enforcing $$1 variables for setup $$2.

1101	user
