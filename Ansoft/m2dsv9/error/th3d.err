1102  fatal
1102  Command line parameters are not valid.
 
1103  fatal
1103  The feature requested has not been implemented yet.

1104  fatal

1208  fatal
1208  The thermal setup is inconsistent. The most probable
1208  reason is a boundary condition definition on a solid 
1208  with zero thermal conductivity. Please note that solids
1208  with zero thermal conductivity are automatically
1208  excluded from the simulation region.

1209  fatal
1209  The thermal setup is not consistent: There are two
1209  or more touching Temperature boundary conditions with
1209  different prescribed temperature values. 


1301  fatal
1301  Cannot recover from loss mapping failure.

1302  fatal
1302  Cannot fix orientation on resistive shell.
