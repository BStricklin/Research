2045    user
2045    This project contains all perfect conductors, so DC R/L results
2045	will be equivalent to AC R/L results.  Since DC solutions require
2045	full volume meshing, you should only solve the AC problem for better
2045	efficiency.

2046	user
2046	Frequency must be greater than zero.

2310    user
2310    You have selected a DC resistance only solution.
2310    The inductance solver is used to compute surface currents in
2310    DC projects with perfect conductors. Since surface currents
2310    affect resistance values, you must also solve for inductance
2310    to obtain the correct resistance matrix.
 
2311    user
2311    This project contains only perfect conductors. The DC solution
2311    of this project will be inefficient and will give the same 
2311    results as the AC solution. Please assign the true conductor
2311    material to each perfect conductor and request an AC solution.

2316 user
2316 "$$1" is not a valid option.
2316 The valid options are "All" (reduce on all matrix), 
2316                       "Cap" (reduce on Capitance matrix),
2316			   "DC"  (reduce on DC Inductance/Resistance matrix) and
