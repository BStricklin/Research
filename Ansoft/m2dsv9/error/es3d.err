1001  fatal
1001  Module $$1 died unexpectedly.
1001  Possible reasons:
1001   (1) insufficient disk space
1001   (2) singular matrix due to improper problem setup
1001   (3) unknown error

1002 user
1002 Some (or all) mesh files are missing.
1002 Please create a mesh and save the files.

1003 user
1003 To perform this operation you must have a
1003 vector in the top register of the calculator.

1004 user
1004 Material attributes are not set yet.

1005 user
1005 Some inline function is not available.

1006 user
1006 This operation requires a solved problem.  Please
1006 solve the problem or retrieve the solution files.

1007 user
1007 There is a voltage boundary on "$$1"
1007 which is a floating conductor.  Please redefine
1007 the problem to remove this condition.

1008 user
1008 All objects are conductors so there is no interior
1008 electric field.  Please remove this condition
1008 by redefining material attributes.

1009 user
1009 Plane "$$1" is not existing. Enter the plane now.

1010 user
1010 You need two planes for setting matching boundary.
1010 Please exit this "define matching boundaries" panel and
1010 define proper planes.

1011 user
1011 Inline function "$$1" is not available. 
1011 Enter the function now.

1012 user
1012 Matching boundary is not set properly.  Either plane or 
1012 attached 2d-solids are not set.  Please set your boundary again.

1013 user
1013 You have not selected all the necessary options to generate
1013 a plot.  Please check your settings and try again.

1014 fatal
1014 Problem cannot be solved, because
1014 no excitation has been defined.

1015 fatal
1015 Object "$$1" is not a conductor. Please redefine "$$1" 
1015 as a conductor and define Dirichlet boundary on it. Or 
1015 unselect it in 'Setup Parameter' for C matrix calculation.

1016 fatal
1016 Object "$$1" is a floating conductor. Please redefine "$$1" 
1016 as a non-floating conductor and define Dirichlet boundary on it.
1016 Or unselect it in 'Setup Parameter' for C matrix calculation.

1017    fatal
1017    Unable to start the sub-process, es2d,
1017    which solves for the port parameters.

1018 	fatal
1018 	Unable to solve port because "$$1" is not a valid port.
1018 	Please redefine port in Define Boundaries/Ports.

1019 	fatal
1019 	Unable to solve problem because of illegal material
1019	or boundary setup. Please verify setup.  

1020 	fatal
1020 	There is no conductor selected for capacitance
1020	calculation on port "$$1". Please check your problem
1020	setup in "Select Conductor".  

1021    user
1021    In order to set up matching boundary, you need
1021    identical geometric patterns on master and slave
1021    planes.  Please check your matching setup.  You
1021    may need to check your solid model as well.

1022    user
1022    In order to set up matching boundary, you need
1022    identical geometric patterns on master and slave
1022    planes.  Apparently, there are vertices on your master
1022    plane which do not exactly match corresponding vertices
1022    on your slave plane. For example, for the point of
1022    $$1    
1022    on your master plane, no matched point on the slave 
1022    plane can be found.  Total number of such mis-matched
1022    points is: $$2.
1022    Please quit and check your solid model carefully...

1023 fatal
1023 One of the objects of the matrix setup is a floating conductor. 
1023 Please redefine the object as a non-floating conductor and 
1023 define Dirichlet boundary on it.
1023 Or unselect it in 'Setup Executive Parameters/Matrix...' for 
1023 C matrix calculation.

1024 fatal
1024 One of the objects of the matrix setup is not a conductor. 
1024 Please redefine the object as a conductor and define Dirichlet 
1024 boundary on it. Or 
1024 unselect it in 'Setup Executive Parameters/Matrix...' for 
1024 C matrix calculation.

1100    fatal
1100    Insufficient memory for module $$1.

1200    fatal
1200    Error in writing the file.
1200    Possible causes are:
1200       - Out of disk space.
1200       - No file access privileges.
1200       - Network or hardware problems.

1201 fatal
1201 Negative mind is detected.

1202 fatal
1202 No objects are included in solution region.
 
1203 fatal
1203 Cannot calculate Lorentz force/torque on perfect conducting
1203 objects or on objects which are excluded from solution region.

1204 fatal
1204 Unable to finish the solution.
1204 Please check the problem setup.

1205 fatal
1205 No unknowns to solve
1205 Please use manual mesh and try again.

1206 fatal
1206 Second order addition error
 
1207 fatal
1207 Illegal face number
 
1208 fatal
1208 Mismatched mid point

1209 fatal
1209 Cannot find an attribute with a given name or solid number
 
1043    fatal
1043    There is no license for module $$1.

2000 fatal
2000 Unable to start matrix solver
 
2001 fatal
