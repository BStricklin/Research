I.   What is Maxwell SV?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maxwell SV is a feature limited version of Ansoft's commercially
distributed Maxwell 2D software. Ansoft offers this version of Maxwell
2D to foster and encourage the development of engineering skills
throughout the electromechanical design community.

Maxwell SV supports the following 2D solver types:
  
  - Electrostatic (XY and RZ symmetry)
  - Magnetostatic (XY and RZ symmetry)
  - Eddy Current  (XY and RZ symmetry)
  - DC Conduction (XY and RZ symmetry)
  - AC Conduction (XY symmetry)
  - Eddy Axial    (XY symmetry)

Thermal and Transient solvers, parametric capability
and equivalent circuit generation are not available in Maxwell SV.
However, these features are available in the commercially distributed
Maxwell 2D software. There are no additional limitations in the
student version regarding the number of model objects, material
properties, mesh size or post processing capability.

III.  Installation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Installing with existing Ansoft products

If you have other Ansoft software installed, it is recommended
that you install new software in that same directory. Each new major
version of Ansoft software, as well as student versions, get installed
into a unique sub-directory within the installation directory specified.
This allows different Ansoft software, commercial and student versions
as well as newer versions of the same software to co-exist independently
of one another. 


B. Licensing

This software does not require a license manager to operate.
However, by using the software, you agree to adhere to the terms of
the accompanying license agreement.
